Small business entities are also able to immediately deduct an eligible amount included in the second element of a depreciating asset's cost.\nThe 5-year 'lock out' rule is suspended until 30 June 2024. This rule prevented small business entities from re-entering the simplified depreciation regime if they opted out.\nTo claim a deduction under the instant asset write-off, complete item 6 \u2013 label X \u2013 Depreciation expenses and item 10 \u2013 label A \u2013 Deduction for certain assets.\nFor more information, see Small Business Support \u2013 $20,000 instant asset write-off.\nSmall business energy incentive\nThe Treasury Laws Amendment (Support for Small Business Charities, and other Measures) Act 2024\nExternal Link\nprovides businesses with an aggregated annual turnover of less than $50 million with access to a bonus deduction equal to 20% of the cost of eligible assets and improvements to existing assets that support more efficient energy use.\nThis is a temporary measure to support small businesses to improve their energy efficiency and save on energy bills. The bonus deduction applies to the cost of eligible assets and improvements up to a maximum amount of $100,000 with the maximum bonus deduction being $20,000.\nTo claim the bonus deduction for the small business energy incentive complete item 7 \u2013 label K \u2013 Small business energy incentive.\nFor more information, see Small business energy incentive.\nThin capitalisation\nThe Treasury Laws Amendment (Making Multinationals Pay Their Fair Share \u2013 Integrity and Transparency) Act 2024\nExternal Link\namends thin capitalisation rules for income years starting on or after 1 July 2023.\nUnder the new thin capitalisation rules:\nThe newly classified 'general class investors' will be subject to one of 3 new tests\nFixed ratio test\nGroup ratio test\nThird party debt test.\nFinancial entities will continue to be subject to the existing safe harbour test and worldwide gearing test or may choose the new third party debt test.\nAuthorised deposit-taking institutions (ADIs) will continue to be subject to the existing thin capitalisation rules.\nThe arm\u2019s length debt test will be removed.\nThese rules are supported by the new integrity rules \u2013 debt deduction creation rules, which will apply to assessments for income years starting on or after 1 July 2024. If you answer yes at item 29 \u2013 label O \u2013 Did the thin capitalisation provisions affect you?, on the Company tax return 2024, you must also complete and lodge an International dealing schedule 2024.\nFor more information, see Thin capitalisation.\nTrust income schedule\nFrom the 2024 income year, if you received one or more distributions from trusts, you must complete a Trust income schedule 2024 and attach it to your company tax return. The trust income schedule details each distribution that you receive from trusts.\nComplete the schedule if you report a distribution from a trust at:\nitem 6 Calculation of total profit or loss \u2013 labels E, H\nitem 7 Reconciliation to taxable income or loss \u2013 label A\nitem 8 Financial and other information \u2013 labels G, R, B, U, V.\nFor information to help you complete the trust income schedule and who must complete the schedule, see Trust income schedule and instructions 2024.\nOff-market share buy-backs and selective share cancellations\nThe Treasury Laws Amendment (2023 Measures No. 1) Act 2023\nExternal Link\nmade changes to align the tax treatment of off-market share buy-backs undertaken by listed public companies with the treatment of on-market share buy-backs. It also made changes in respect of selective share cancellations undertaken by listed public companies.\nAs a result of these changes no part of the purchase price in respect of an off-market share buy-back undertaken by a listed public company is taken to be a dividend. In addition, a dividend distribution made by a listed public company that is consideration for the cancellation of a membership interest in itself, as part of a selective reduction of capital, is unfrankable.\nA listed public company that undertakes an off-market share buy-back or selective share cancellation may be required to debit the balance of its franking account. \nThe changes apply to off-market buy-backs announced and undertaken by a listed public company after 7:30 pm (AEDT) on 25 October 2022, and to selective share cancellations announced and undertaken by a listed public company on or after 18 November 2022.\nFor listed public companies, amounts you enter at item 8 \u2013 label J \u2013 Franked dividends paid or label K \u2013 Unfranked dividends paid may be impacted by these changes.\nFor more information, see Improving the integrity of off-market share buy-backs.\nFranked distributions funded by capital raisings\nThe Treasury Laws Amendment (2023 Measures No. 1) Act 2023\nExternal Link\namends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to add distributions funded by capital raisings to the list of distributions that are unfrankable.\nFor more information, see Franked distributions funded by capital raisings.\nOffshore banking unit regime\nThe Treasury Laws Amendment (2021 Measures No. 2) Act 2021\nExternal Link\namends Australia's Offshore Banking Unit (OBU) Regime. This change became law on 13 September 2021.\nThe government has removed the concessional tax treatment for OBUs in respect of offshore banking activities, effective from the start of the OBU\u2019s 2023\u201324 income year.\nRules that deem an OBU to have only paid a fraction of its foreign income tax on its assessable OB income also no longer apply. This means you will need to calculate the foreign income tax offset (FITO) using the ordinary rules.\nFor interest paid on or after 1 January 2024, the government has also removed the interest withholding tax exemption for OBUs.\nFor more information, see Changes to Australia's Offshore Banking Unit Regime.\nAASB 17 accounting standard\nThe Treasury Laws Amendment (Support for Small Business and Charities and Other Measures) Act 2024\nExternal Link\namends Division 321 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to broadly align the treatment of general insurance contracts with the AASB 17 accounting standard.\nThis change to tax law allows general insurers to continue to use audited financial reporting information, calculated according to the new standard, as the basis for their tax returns. This measure is effective for income years starting on or after 1 January 2023.\nNew items in the Company tax return 2024\nIn the Company tax return 2024, the following labels have been added:\nItem 7 Reconciliation to taxable income or loss\nLabel K Small business energy incentive\nItem 24 Digital games tax offset\nlabel A Current year refundable DGTO amount being claimed\nlabel B Total amount of current year DGTO already claimed or being claimed by related companies.\nRemoved items in the Company tax return 2024\nIn the Company tax return 2024, the following labels have been removed:\nItem 7 Reconciliation to taxable income or loss\nlabel L Small business technology investment boost\nlabel P Offshore banking unit adjustment\nItem 9 Capital allowances\nlabels P to U \u2013 the temporary full expensing opt out related labels\nItem 13 Losses information\nAll tax loss carried back related labels (except labels U and V).\nContinue to: How to lodge your company tax return and pay\nReturn to: How to get the Company tax return 2024\nQC101684\nPrint or Download",
